                    This was a fun procject. It was step by step CSS project I did in

                    , but it wasn't a step by step. I had to use my own ideas with
                    the perameters that were set. I went above and beyond to make this page look good, because it was
                    about my teacher in the

            My daddy always told me that "if you ain't got nothin nice to say don't say nothin' at all." With that being
            said there's not a lot to say about myself. I've done some bad things in my life. I've struggled with
            addiction ever since i was a kid. I ended up going to prison because of it, but I've come out better for it
            on the other end. I've turned my life around. I have a job that i work everyday. I'm Taking classes with the
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.perseverenow.org/">Persevere Program

            . I have also been building a
            better relationship with my family. I'm determined to make something of myself, so I can have "something to
            say."
